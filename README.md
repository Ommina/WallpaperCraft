## About

WallpaperCraft adds hundreds of new building blocks in a vast range of colors, integrating classic building blocks like clay, wood, glass and bricks.

The 1.7.10 and 1.10.2 version are authored and released by AaronMC.
The 1.14.4 version is authored and released by Ommina.

The 1.14.4 version is a complete rewrite, using no code from the earlier versions.  It does, however, reuse textures and item/block names from AaronMC's original repository.

## Downloads

* 1.7.10 and 1.10.2 versions have been removed from CurseForge, presumably by the author.
* 1.14.4 version can be found on [CurseForge - Wallpapercraft: A Fresh Roll](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wallpapercraft-a-fresh-roll)

## Credits

* Textures are believed to be originally created by CurseForge user Oliviaoliviasson

* zh_cn translation by CurseForge user 2001whl.  Thanks!
