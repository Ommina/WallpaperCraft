1.2.4  2020-09-25

ADD: Further changes to support in-world block changes for stairs, slabs, and wall.

Version 1.2.3 has been archived on CF to avoid users downloading it pointlessly.

1.2.3  2020-09-24

ADD: Internal changes to support press crafting recipes for the three dependent mods (stairs, slabs, walls).

There should be no noticeable user-facing changes.  Users who do -not- intend on installing any of the child mods can give this release a miss.
