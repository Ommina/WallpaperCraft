1.0.9  2020-06-16

And fewer than 12h after "the last 1.14.4 version"", a new 1.14.4 version.

ADD: zh_cn translation by 2001whl.

1.0.8  2020-08-15

FIX: Typo in pattern press holder.  The only user-facing change is the press might start appearing in village chests.

Barring the discovery of a significant bug -- not especially likely at this point -- this will be the last 1.14.4 version to be released.


1.0.7 2020-06-30

FIX: Add missing Wooden Plank Press recipe.

1.0.6 2019-11-25

CHANGED: Compress Block Textures.  Across all 2300 textures, it makes a difference of about 240KB.  Which is hardly Earth-shattering, but all the cool kids are doing it, so I guess I will too.


1.0.5 2019-10-05

ADD: Ability to sneak-scroll through a block's variants within a colour.  Feedback is invited here.
ADD: Spawn a handful of base blocks and a (non-glass, non-glowing) pattern in village mason and 'generic' house chests.


1.0.4  2019-09-13

FIX: Update to play nicely with Forge 28.1 (the "requires language provider javafml:28 we have found 28.1" error)


1.0.3  2019-08-16

FIX: JEI not showing the "base block + patterns" recipe, making finding the starting block itself very difficult indeed.  (Thanks FraukeS for the issue report.)

ADD: Wool Press recipe

CHANGED: Patterned Wool Press recipe
